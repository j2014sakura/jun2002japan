Trouble with withdraw. ã€€withdrew XEM to Poloniex. However, I forgot to print NEM message and I withdrew as it is. Poloniex has not been able to confirm payment. What should I do?  Is it possible to cancel the withdrawal procedure? A report on withdrawal without NEM message is raised to NEM Wallet.
